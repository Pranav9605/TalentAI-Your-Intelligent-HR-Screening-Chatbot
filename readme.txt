# HiHire AI: Intelligent Recruitment Redefined

HiHire AI is an intelligent HR chatbot designed to transform recruitment screening. By allowing you to upload a Job Description (JD) file, HiHire AI leverages advanced NLP techniques and the Gemini API to provide detailed, context-aware answers to HR-related queries. Whether you're asking about required experience, qualifications, or specific job requirements, our system uses the uploaded JD as a knowledge base to generate insightful responses.

## Features

- **Job Description Upload:**  
  Easily upload a JD (in TXT format) to provide context for HR-related queries.
  
- **Intelligent HR Query Handling:**  
  The chatbot uses spaCy-powered NLP to detect HR-specific queries and generate tailored responses using the Gemini API.

- **Unified Chat Interface:**  
  Engage in interactive conversations through an intuitive Streamlit frontend with a real-time chat history display.

- **Customizable and Extensible:**  
  Built with FastAPI and Streamlit, HiHire AI is designed for easy customization and extension.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HiHire-AI.git
   cd HiHire-AI
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key for Google Generative AI:
   ```dotenv
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install and Run the Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Download the spaCy English model if not already installed:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The backend server will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

4. **Install and Run the Frontend:**

   Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
   Your browser should open the interface (typically at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

## Usage

1. **Upload a Job Description (JD):**  
   Use the file uploader in the Streamlit sidebar to upload your JD file (TXT format). The JD will be stored and used as context for HR queries.

2. **Ask HR-Related Questions:**  
   Type HR queries (e.g., "What experience is required for this position?") into the chat box. The system will detect the HR-related intent, include the uploaded JD in the prompt, and generate a tailored response using the Gemini API.

3. **View Chat History:**  
   All interactions are displayed in the chat history section for easy reference.

## Customization

- **NLP & Intent Detection:**  
  Modify the HR-related keyword list in `backend/main.py` (within the `multi_intent_classifier` function) to fine-tune query detection.

- **Response Generation:**  
  Update the prompt in the `get_hr_response` function to adjust the tone or detail of the responses.
